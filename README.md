# NeoVim Setup

This is my current NeoVim Setup. It is heavily inspired by [@ThePrimeagen](https://github.com/ThePrimeagen/init.lua) setup. 

It has few plugins and ThePrimeagen's time proven remaps. I am still a noob when it comes to Vi and NeoVim ecosystem, so I will keep my plugins minimal for time being.

I use Vim btw.
